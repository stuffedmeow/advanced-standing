          <p>Prior to my second semester at Purchase College, I did not have any strong passions for anything. I had always been into the arts, but didn’t feel strong enough to do anything with it. Arts management was something that I thought I could
            drift in for four years so I picked it up as my major, studying cases and making budget sheets. But class felt mundane, and I had no drive to learn any of it. After a full semester, I decided to explore my options. Up until that point, I
            had
            written myself off as a creative for not excelling in the visual arts. Having to reflect, it suddenly occurred to me that maybe there were other ways that I could use to find my creative role in the world. It sounds so simple but I had
            never had the exposure or resources to explore other options of creative output before. After talking to a friend who was already in the program, I learned about New Media for the first time and it blew my mind. I haven’t turned back
            since.</p>
          <p>Presently, I’ve completed all the foundation courses for my major in New Media. Introduction to Sound, Video Art, and Introduction to Web are some classes that stuck out to me in particular. The concept of manipulating something that
            can’t be seen was novel to me, and I struggled in grasping the basics of intro to sound in the beginning. Something about it just didn’t seem to be clicking for me. However, as video art picked up and we began making our own videos, I
            found myself now hypersensitive and aware of the role that audio played in accompanying and sometimes leading pieces. Taking both of these classes at the same time guided me in understanding them both holistically. In terms of intro to
            web, I had always been interested in learning how to create and leave my mark on this realm of the internet that seems to rule my time. Learning about netart, video art, and sound art was so different yet intune with what I consumed from
            the media everyday. I felt unbearably excited by the possibility of creating my own contributions.</p>
          <p>Since the formal introduction of new media in my life, I’ve become someone completely different yet completely similar to who I’ve always known myself to be. Now, there is this overwhelming feeling within me that I’ve never known to
            exist before. It drives me to care; it encourages me not to be intimidated by my late start or lack of resources. I want to grow with this feeling. I will make it grow with me by feeding it my endeavors in new media, and since then I’ve
            been more than excited to do so.</p>

          <p>After completing the foundation courses, I found that I particularly enjoyed creating pieces in the video form. I picked up a film/video production minor so that I could further explore this interest, and took classes such as
            Introduction to Digital Filmmaking, Screenwriting I, and Performance Art. In the future, I will be taking Documentary Filmmaking and Short Film Production in order to complete this minor. I would be interested in taking Video Art II,
            Digital Dimensions, Video Graphics, and possibly Material Distribution and Digital Storytelling after advanced standing. These classes interest me in the way that they weave visual concepts with explorations in different media in order to
            convey messages while appealing to audiences. I want to take these classes to hone my skills in using creative tools, and to develop my ability in using these resources in order to effectively convey these messages that I want to convey.
          </p>
          <p>Currently I’ve not yet decided on what I would like to do for my senior project, but I am certain that I will find inspiration. In this realm of new media that we’ve found ourselves in, there is an endless supply. Themes that I am
            interested in exploring include interpersonal relationships, loneliness, gender identity, and possibly dreams involving surrealist concepts. However, before completely deciding on my concept for this important project, I would first
            like to experiment more with the mediums that I am already using, such as with video and sound. Cyberspace intrigues me as well; I want to create projects on the web and in unity not just to fulfill requirements for assignments, but to
            have fun learning from them.</p>
          <p>Moreover, ideally we would be allowed on campus before/by the time of my senior year as I am also interested in testing out other mediums and technology such as large format printing and 3D printers. At home I do not have access to
            such resources, and so currently I cannot begin experimenting with them. In the meantime, I will continue trying my best with what I do have, and push the limits of the mediums and themes that I am already in communication with, in
            order to work towards this significant decision.</p>
